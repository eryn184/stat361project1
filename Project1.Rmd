Questions:
Is it okay that our response is an indicator variable? (Heart disease vs no heart disease) -> not looking at linear vs non linear relationships with dotplots since response isn't quantitative

```{r}
# Read in data
heart_df <- read_csv("heart.csv", 
                     col_types = cols(Sex = col_factor(),
                                      ChestPainType = col_factor(),
                                      FastingBS = col_factor(),
                                      RestingECG = col_factor(),
                                      ExerciseAngina = col_factor(),
                                      ST_Slope = col_factor(),
                                      HeartDisease = col_factor()
                                      )
                     ) 
```


```{r}
# Age vs Heart Disease
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = HeartDisease, y = Age))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# Sex vs Heart Disease
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = HeartDisease, fill = Sex))+
  geom_bar()
summary(heart_df$Sex) #Way more male participants (725) than female (193)
```

```{r}
# Chest Pain Type vs Heart Disease
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = HeartDisease, fill = ChestPainType))+
  geom_bar()

```{r}
# Resting BP vs Heart Disease

  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# Cholesterol vs Heart Disease
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = HeartDisease, y = Cholesterol))+
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(heart_df, aes(x = Cholesterol))+
  geom_histogram() #What's with all the zeros?

```{r}

  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
